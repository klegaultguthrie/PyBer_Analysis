# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create a summary dataframe of the ride data by city type. City type in this case is defined by the following categories:
+ Urban
+ Suburban
+ Rural

The information can further be utilized to analyze trends and assist Pyber management with their strategy and business decisions.


### The Results:
The ley performance indicators that were collected are:

+ Total rides
+ Total drivers
+ Total fares
+ Average fare per ride / driver
+ Total fares by city type

Not surprisingly, the majority of fares, rides and drivers are concentrated within urban centres while we see a much smaller concentration of fares, riders and drivers in rural areas. Despite this however, out analysis indicates that although the demand in suburban and rural areas is lower, riders are willing to pay a premium price for access to ride sharing services. as per the prices below:

Average Fare per ride
1) Urban    $24.53
2) Suburban $30.97
3) Rural    $34.62

The chart below provides a clear summary of the differences in the market size from small to large metropolitan areas.

### Summary:

The information collected in this summary dataframe is the basis for the following recommendations:
1) Although the rural and suburban areas have a smaller demand for ridesharing services, it is worthwhile to service these markets as this integration will allow Pyber to expand their branding and diversify their revenue sources.
2) Pyber may look into decreasing their cost per ride (marginally) in urban areas in an effort to gain a competitive advantage and deter other competitors from entering the marker.
3) Lastly, the integration in point 1, will allow Pyber to retain valuable drivers and riders who move from one market to another.
